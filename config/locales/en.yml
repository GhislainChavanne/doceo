  modal1-title: "Why Saibaba?"
  modal1-text1: "Education is a major issue in India, a challenge for the future. In 2010, India passed a law guaranteeing the right to free education for every child aged 6-14 years."
  mais: "However,"
  modal1-text2: "the level of teaching in government-funded schools is poor: too few teachers with too little training.  Classes are too large – up to 60 pupils in large towns.  Absenteeism amongst both teachers and children is very high. "
  modal1-text3: "Furthermore, the infrastructure is inadequate, with a lack of running water and toilet facilities."
  modal1-text4: "Finally, for the poorest families, children are a source of income, particularly girls. They are made to beg, to help their mothers, to care for their siblings."
  modal1-text5: "Today, in India, it is estimated that 50% of women and 30% of men are illiterate"
  modal1-text6: "According to the most recent Unesco statistics, 15 million girls aged 6-10 years do not attend school – 25% of their generation."
